# NextEvents

I wrote this while following Maximilian Schwarzmuller's "Next.js and React" course.

A Single Page Application using Next.js, React, Context API, MongoDB, Firebase (Realtime Database), JavaScript, HTML

I have connected this repo to Vercel.  
Open <http://next-events-three.vercel.app/> to see the project in production.

## Installation

```sh
yarn install
```

## Usage

```sh
yarn dev
```

This runs the application in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in a browser.
